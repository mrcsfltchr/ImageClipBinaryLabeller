# Labelling tool for binary classes.



# This class is a PyQT GUI for labelling images as one of two classes. It was made for labelling clips which contained either a phospholipid vesicle or did not contain a vesicle. 
# The GUI allows the user to flick through input images using a 'next' and 'previous' button. 




# As was convenient for me during building this tool, the images must be input as a large numpy array. This multidimensional array has shape: Number of images x Image height x Image width


#This input could be adapted to allow image files to be inputted using a library which converts image compressed files to numpy arrays. 


#The developer thanks the writers of qimage2ndarray, PyQt, (qtpy in Anaconda) and more
